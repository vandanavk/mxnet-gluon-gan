# DCGAN using Apache MXNet

It is recommended to execute this example on GPU.

2 options to try out this notebook:
1. [Run this notebook on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/piyushghai/mxnet-gluon-gan/blob/dcgan/dcgan/dcgan_faces.ipynb)
    
    Pre-requisites to execute on Colab: Select Python, GPU as the runtime, CUDA 9.2 and MXNet 1.4.1 (mxnet-cu92) installed.
    
    Note: The step to install these pre-requisites is already included in the notebook.
2. [Try this notebook in Amazon Sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html)
    
    Pre-requisites to execute on SageMaker: Clone this GitHub repo in SageMaker (switch to dcgan branch), select MXNet_p36 as the kernel.
    
    Note: Enabling this kernel, makes the correct version of MXNet & CUDA automatically available for use in SageMaker.
